# Stationery Module Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The "Add Item" button in the Stationery Module was failing with the error:
```
POST https://uizibdtiuvjjikbrkdcv.supabase.co/rest/v1/stationery 401 (Unauthorized)
Error in handleSubmit: {code: '42501', details: null, hint: null, message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "stationery"'}
```

## Root Cause
The application was trying to insert data with columns that didn't exist in the database schema:
- `stock` column was missing from the `stationery` table
- The RLS policy was rejecting the insert because of the schema mismatch

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20250915000000_add_stock_to_stationery.sql`)
- Added `stock` column to the `stationery` table
- Created indexes for better performance
- Updated existing records to populate the stock column
- Ensured profit calculation function and trigger are up to date

### 2. Application Code Updates (`src/components/modules/StationeryModule.tsx`)
- Made `stock`, `low_stock_threshold`, and `profit_per_unit` optional in the `StationeryItem` interface
- Added schema checking in `handleSubmit` to conditionally include the `stock` field
- Updated `fetchItems` to handle missing fields gracefully
- Improved error handling with more specific error messages
- Updated table rendering to handle optional `stock` field

### 3. Support Scripts
- `fix-stationery-stock.sql`: Raw SQL for manual database fix
- `apply-database-fix.js`: Script to generate SQL statements
- `verify-fix.js`: Script to verify the fix
- `DATABASE-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Detailed instructions for applying the fix

### 4. Package.json Updates
- Added `fix:database` and `verify:fix` scripts for easy execution

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Developers
1. Run `npm run fix:database` to see the SQL statements needed
2. Copy the SQL statements to your Supabase SQL editor
3. Execute each statement

### For Database Administrators
1. Copy the SQL from `fix-stationery-stock.sql`
2. Paste and execute in the Supabase SQL editor

## Verification
After applying the fix:
1. Run `npm run verify:fix` to check if the fix was applied correctly
2. Try adding a new stationery item in the application
3. The error should be resolved

## Additional Improvements
- Better error handling with specific messages for RLS policy violations
- Graceful degradation when database schema doesn't match expectations
- Schema checking to prevent similar issues in the future
