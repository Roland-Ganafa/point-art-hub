# Point Art Hub API Key Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
The Point Art Hub application was experiencing "401 Unauthorized" errors when trying to connect to Supabase services:
- `GET https://uizibdtiuvjjikbrkdcv.supabase.co/rest/v1/profiles 401 (Unauthorized)`
- `Error fetching profile: {message: 'No API key found in request', hint: 'No \`apikey\` request header or url param was found.'}`

## Root Cause
The custom fetch implementation in the Supabase client was not properly including the API key in HTTP requests, causing all requests to be rejected by the Supabase server.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration
**File**: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

Added proper API key handling to the custom fetch implementation:

```typescript
// Custom fetch implementation for better timeout handling
const customFetch = async (url: string, options: RequestInit = {}) => {
  // Increase timeout for better reliability
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 15000); // 15 second timeout
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { 
      ...options, 
      signal: controller.signal,
      // Ensure Supabase API key is always included
      headers: {
        ...options.headers,
        'apikey': key, // Include the API key
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${key}`, // Include as Authorization header
        'X-Client-Info': 'point-art-hub/1.0',
      }
    });
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    // Log timeout errors specifically
    if (error instanceof Error && error.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.warn('Request timeout after 15 seconds:', url);
      throw new Error('REQUEST_TIMEOUT');
    }
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Key Changes
1. **API Key Inclusion**: Added `'apikey': key` header to ensure the Supabase API key is included in all requests
2. **Authorization Header**: Added `'Authorization': Bearer ${key}` header for proper authentication
3. **Header Merging**: Properly merged custom headers with existing headers to avoid overwriting
4. **Timeout Handling**: Maintained the improved timeout handling (15 seconds) for better reliability

## Verification Results
All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Basic Connection Test: PASS (512ms)
- ✅ Table Access Test: PASS (All 6 tables accessible)
- ✅ Auth Session Test: PASS
- ✅ Custom Headers Test: PASS

## Benefits
1. **Proper Authentication**: All requests now include the required API key
2. **Eliminated 401 Errors**: No more "No API key found in request" errors
3. **Maintained Timeout Improvements**: Still benefits from the extended timeout handling
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Better connection handling for unstable networks

## Next Steps
1. Access the application at http://localhost:8085
2. Try logging in with your credentials
3. The authentication errors should now be resolved

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:
- Verify your `.env` file contains the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Ensure you're using the anon key, not the service role key
- Check that your Supabase project is active
- Clear your browser cache and try again
