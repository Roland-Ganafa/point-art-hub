# Database Migration History

This file tracks the successful application of database migrations to the production Supabase instance.

## Migration History

### September 1, 2023

Applied the following migrations to fix deployment errors:

1. **20230831000000_create_stationery_daily_sales_table.sql**
   - Created stationery_daily_sales table with required columns
   - Added RLS policies for proper access control
   - Created necessary indexes for performance
   - Added triggers for updated_at timestamp

2. **20230831000001_add_missing_columns_to_gift_daily_sales.sql**
   - Added description column to gift_daily_sales table
   - Added sold_by column with reference to profiles table
   - Created index on sold_by column for better performance

These migrations were necessary to match the database schema with the application code that was previously pushed to GitHub, resolving deployment errors related to table structure mismatches.

## Notes

For future migrations, remember that Supabase database changes require manual application either through:
1. Supabase SQL Editor (directly copying and executing the SQL)
2. Supabase CLI with `supabase db push` command

Database schema synchronization is not automatic when pushing code changes to GitHub.
